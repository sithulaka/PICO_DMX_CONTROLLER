# Full Universe DMX Receiver

The updated DMX receiver now displays all 512 channels in the universe with comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

## Features

### 📊 Full Universe Display
- **All 512 Channels**: Shows every channel value from 1-512
- **Organized Format**: 16 channels per line with clear formatting
- **Visual Separation**: Grouped in blocks of 128 channels for readability
- **Zero Highlighting**: Zero values are clearly indicated

### ⏰ Multiple Display Modes

#### 1. **Startup Display**
- Shows initial universe state (all zeros until data received)
- Immediate feedback on receiver initialization

#### 2. **Real-time Change Monitoring**
- Instant notification when configured channels change
- Shows old → new values for easy tracking

#### 3. **Periodic Full Universe** (Every 30 seconds)
- Complete 512-channel display when signal is active
- Includes current frame count

#### 4. **No Signal Display** (Every 3 seconds)
- Shows current channel values even when no DMX signal
- Useful for troubleshooting and seeing "stale" data

#### 5. **Summary Status** (Every 10 seconds)
- Active channels count (channels > 0)
- Highest value and its channel
- Configured channels verification
- Overall system status

## Monitoring Capabilities

### Real-time Feedback
- **Channel Changes**: `Channel 1 changed: 0 -> 255`
- **Signal Status**: `📡 DMX signal active - 1250 frames received`
- **No Signal Warning**: `⚠️ WARNING: No DMX signal detected!`

### Statistical Information
```
=== DMX SUMMARY STATUS ===
Total frames received: 1250
Active channels: 9/512 (channels with value > 0)
Highest value: 255 on channel 1
Configured channels: Ch1=255✓ Ch2=128✓ Ch10=200✓ Ch50=100✓ Ch512=255✓
Status: All configured channels match ✓
==========================
```

## Use Cases

### 1. **Troubleshooting**
- See exactly what's being received on every channel
- Identify which channels have unexpected values
- Monitor signal presence and stability

### 2. **System Verification** 
- Confirm transmitter is sending correct values
- Verify all 512 channels are properly transmitted
- Check for signal integrity issues

### 3. **Real-time Monitoring**
- Watch channel values change in real-time
- Monitor DMX fixture behavior
- Debug lighting control systems

### 4. **No-Signal Diagnostics**
- View last received values when signal is lost
- Understand system state during interruptions
- Maintain visibility during troubleshooting

## Display Timing

| Display Type | Frequency | Condition |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Startup | Once | At initialization |
| Channel Changes | Immediate | When values change |
| Signal Check | Every 3s | Always |
| Summary Status | Every 10s | Always |
| Full Universe | Every 30s | When signal present |
| No Signal Display | Every 3s | When no signal |

## Technical Benefits

- **Complete Visibility**: Never miss what's happening on any channel
- **Always Available**: Shows values even without active DMX signal
- **Organized Display**: Easy to read 16-channel rows with visual separators
- **Statistics**: Active channel count, maximum values, status verification
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate feedback on channel changes

This comprehensive monitoring makes the receiver perfect for DMX system debugging, verification, and real-time monitoring applications.
